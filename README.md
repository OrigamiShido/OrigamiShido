### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Origami Shido**(æŠ˜ã‚Šç´™ã€€ç´«è—¤). Currently studying in Wuhan University, EIE(Electronic Information Engineering) major.

#### About my name

OrigamiShido is originated from Japanese light novel *Date a Live*'s two characters, Tobiichi Origami and Itsuka Shidou.

#### Currently learning

- C, C++ å’Œ Python
- Mathematica å’Œ Matlab
- wikitext
- markdown å’Œ latex
- Verilog

#### Why GitHubï¼Ÿ

Hope to use GitHub to manage my code and learn more interesting things. Actually I found here quite inspiring.

#### Hobbies

Games, VOCALOID, etc. I'm fond of any interesting thing.

#### Current status

Try to be.

To be honest, I'm quite anxious about the current invironment and worrying about the future of my cyber life. I cannot figure out some efficient solutions temporarily, but I will try.

*I think I have nothing but my hope, faith, vigor, and pain.*

### Current target

Actually, I find that my life is somehow overwhelming. In current status I will only update my anthology, making no code contributions but only to express my feelings.
